# Ticket progress

## Current focus

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Active ticket** | `—` (no active ticket; allocate next **`FR-NNNN`** when starting new product work) |
| **Active phase** | `idle` |
| **Branch / worktree** | default branch (`master` / team convention); last shipped: **FR-0001** (PR #5 merged) |
| **Session status** | `ready` |
| **Next agent should** | Start the next feature with **`/feature-request`** (new **`FR-NNNN`**) or pick the smallest open ticket per **How to choose next work** below. |

### Parallel streams (optional)

Use when **more than one** ticket id or **`FR-NNNN`** is actively developed in parallel. Each stream: own `.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/...` worktree and feature-prefixed branch; update **only** your **Progress** row for your ticket.

| Stream label | Ticket(s) | `FR-NNNN` (if any) | Branch / worktree | Owner / note |
|----------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| *(none — single stream)* | — | — | — | — |

## How to choose next work

1. Prefer the **smallest incomplete ticket** whose **Deps** are all **VAL** = `done`.
2. If **Session status** is `blocked`, resolve the blocker before starting new parallel batches.
